On March 27, 2020 U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act authorizing a mind-bending $2 trillion worth of aid funding; I was on day 7 of 10 having COVID-19.

Tons of small business owners like myself were increasingly nervous about our suddenly dry cash flow. In January and February as the murmur of Coronvirus started rising, I felt very confident about my business's cash reserves and naively thought, "if I have to close a month and take a $20,000 hit, I can."

By late March, I wasn't so sure of myself.

## Background

I own a small retail business in New York City. Here is a very rough breakdown of a normal month of revenue and expenses:

* Sales: <span class="profit">60k</span>
* [COGS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp): <span class="loss">30k</span>
* Rent: <span class="loss">8k</span>
* Utilities / Maintenance: <span class="loss">1k</span>
* Payroll: <span class="loss">14k</span>
* Misc: <span class="loss">1k</span>

Roughly my business does <span class="profit">$60k</span> - <span class="loss">$54k</span> = **$6k of profit** per month, operating at a **10% margin**, pretty average for a U.S. business.

On March 20, we had about $65k in our checking account.

### Expenses While Shut Down

My "close a month, lose $20k" arithmetic was basically this.

* Rent: <span class="loss">8k</span>
* Utilities / Maintenance: <span class="loss">.5k</span>
* Payroll: <span class="loss">10k</span> (kept staff on, stopped paying myself)
* Misc: <span class="loss">1k</span>

That adds up to <span class="loss">~$19k</span>. At any given time, I typically have about $20k in outstanding liabilities.

If I don't pay any outstanding liabilities, I can last for about _3 and a half months_. If I pay my outstanding invoices, I have _two months_. Yikes!

My COVID-19 symptoms were moderate. They were bad enough to make me completely miserable and non-functional. My fever peaked at 103 on day 7 and my breathing got tight on day 8. I could barely eat since food tasted awful. (Most food tasted like trying to eat a block of salt.) Fortunately, my symptoms vanished after day 10.

I lost about ten pounds, and I have been (mostly) fine ever since. If I were 10 or 15 years older, would my body have handled it? I don't know. I don't think so.

How many months was the lockdown going to last? Based on my own sickness, I felt that April was done, probably May. I needed cash to float the business.

## Ready, Set... WAIT!

![Not so fast!](https://i.imgur.com/fGh9d8q.jpg)

April 3, 2020: Banks are now [accepting applications](https://www.schgroup.com/resource/blog-post/how-to-begin-your-paycheck-protection-program-application/)! At least that is what the fractured information I could gather said.

I wish I took a screenshot, but Citibank had a SPECIAL COVID-19 PPP ANNOUNCEMENT page on their site. It basically said:

> We are not accepting PPP applications. Do not call us. Do not call your branch. They do not have additional information.

Okay.

I have a business Chase credit card. Maybe I could apply through them? They are already lending me money already! Nope, you need a checking account with them.

Ditto for every other major financial institution.

News from the financial world was that money was going fast and going to run out.

Refresh Citibank: **DO NOT CONTACT US, WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.**

Fuck.

## A Valve Opens

The pressure was mounting, and I couldn't even apply for one of these loans.

My incessant refreshing was rewarded with this on Thursday, April 9th...

![Don't call us, we'll call you](https://i.imgur.com/YI5LL1Y.jpg)

> Don't call us, we'll call you.

There was a form at the bottom of the page to provide your email address. I frantically filled it out thinking, "I might not be the first business to be contacted, but I've been a customer for 10 years, that has to count for something!"

I kept checking my email hourly, waiting for "APPLY FOR YOUR PPP LOAN." Nothing came. Next morning, no email. The weekend came and went with no contact.

Next week business news outlets kept talking about money running out. Then on Thursday, April 16th [the money had run dry](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/this-government-loan-program-has-run-dry-these-people-lost-out.html).

My business had been closed for month, and I didn't see shelter in place, wait sorry _NY PAUSE_, ending anytime soon.

## Big Banks and Loan Processing Fees

Why did Citibank never contact me? It has to do with the fees. Congress and Mnuchin tried to incentivize banks to give smaller loans to businesses like mine, but the funding was too limited.

### Fee payouts

Banks receive the following from the SBA for processing a loan:

* 5% for a loan < $350,000
* 3% between $350k and $2m
* 1% for $2m+

The problem is that the banks knew the demand firsthand. While they could theoretically profit more by processing smaller loans the money would run out before they could. Banks needed to take what they could get when they could and processed as many big dollar loans as fast as possible.

In my network of small business owners, I didn't know anyone who secured a PPP loan in round 1. About half were able to apply. All of our annual revenue lands somewhere in the $500k-$2m range. We are small by any reasonable metric. We all have accounts at large U.S. banks and not a single one of us was able to get a loan.

So why in the middle of a pandemic were banks STILL prioritizing large loans to businesses that likely have greater access to liquidity than me? Well Horatio was once told, "_something is rotten in the state of Denmark._"

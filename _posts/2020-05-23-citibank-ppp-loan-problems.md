title: Citibank Never Let Me Apply for a PPP Loan
---

On Friday, March 27, 2020 the CARES Act was passed authorizing $2 trillion worth of funding; I was on day 7 of 10 having COVID-19. Tons of small business owners like myself were increasingly nervous about our suddenly dry cash flow. As things started heating up in January and February I felt very confident about our cash reserves and naively thought, "if I have to close a month and take a $20,000 hit, I can." By late March, I wasn't so sure of myself.

The CARES Act included $350 billion for loans in the Payroll Protection Program. It was designed to help float payroll and rent expenses for 8 weeks. Perfect! It sounded exactly like what my business needed.

## Background

I own a small retail business in New York City. Here is a very rough breakdown of revenue and expenses:

Revenue: 60k
[COGS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp): 30k
Rent: 8k
Utilities / Maintenance: 1k
Payroll: 14k
Misc: 1k

Doing some quick arithmetic, my business has $60 - $54k = **$6k of profit**. That's operating at a **10% margin**, pretty average for any business in the U.S. On March 20, we had about $65k in our checking account. Let's do a little more arithmetic.

### Expenses While Shut Down
Rent: 8k
Utilities / Maintenance: .25k
Payroll: 10k (kept staff on, stopped paying myself)
Misc: 1k

That adds up to ~$19k. How long can I keep the business going if I don't pay any outstanding bills (at the time about $20k of liabilities outstanding)?

_3.4 months. Yikes._

Given the transmissibility of the disease (I still don't know where I got it from, classic Community Transmission), I grasped the severity of this first hand. On day 7 of the disease I was getting nervous. My fever peaked to 103 that night, and I developed shortness of breath the following - though the fever abated.

If I were 10 or 15 years older, would my body have handled it? I don't know.

How many months was the lockdown going to last? Based on my own experience, I knew that April was done, probably May. I needed cash to float the business.

## Open the Floodgates

April 3, 2020: Banks are now [accepting applications](https://www.schgroup.com/resource/blog-post/how-to-begin-your-paycheck-protection-program-application/)! At least that is what the fractured information I could gather said.

The verbiage of the PPP Loan at the time definitely slanted towards being a grant. _Just make sure you use it for rent and employees_. No problem, can do. Anything I can have to keep that $19k figure as low as possible.

I wish I took a screenshot, but Citibank had a SPECIAL COVID-19 PPP ANNOUNCEMENT page on their site. On it, it said in clear language.

> Do not call us. Do not call your branch. They do not have additional information. We are not accepting PPP applications.

I have a business Chase credit card. Maybe I could apply through them? They are already lending me money already! Nope, you need a checking account with them. Ditto for every other major financial institution.

News from the financial world indicated that money was going fast and going to run out.

Refresh Citibank: **DO NOT CONTACT US, WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.**

Fuck.

## A Valve Opens

The pressure was mounting, and I couldn't even apply for one of these loans.

My incessant refreshing was rewarded with this on April 8th...

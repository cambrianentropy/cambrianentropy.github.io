## What is this Blog?
I have been in the weeds of owning a small business since 2010 in New York City. My experiences have ranged from ordering and processing shipments to cleaning up used drug needles. It's a crazy world out there!

Cambrian Entropy is me stepping back from the minutiae of my work to reflect on the broader trends of our world. I am interested in macroeconomic issues, wealth inequality, and climate degradation.

I occassionally share music, recipes and other random tidbits from time to time.

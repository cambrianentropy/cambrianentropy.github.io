## What is this Blog?
I have been in the weeds of owning a small business since 2010 in New York City. My experiences have ranged from ordering and processing shipments to cleaning up used drug needles. It's a crazy world out there!

Cambrian Entropy is me stepping back from the minutiae of my work to reflect on the broader trends of our world. I am interested in macroeconomic issues, wealth inequality, and climate degradation.

## What is Cambrian Entropy?

Non-sense spurred on by needing a unique username on the internet with some light inspiration.

### Cambrian

Many years ago I was involved in an online community where someone posted a fake band of The Cambrian Explosion. She posted a ton of prehistoric creatures with crudely MS-painted instruments. Always stuck with me and cracks me up to this day.

### Entropy

I read [The Big Picture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture) by Sean Carroll in 2019. My mind was blown when Carroll explained our perception of time being to be related to the second law of thermodynamics. What? Check it out if you like stuff like A Short of History of Nearly Everything, Hawking, Sagan, etc.

## Fun Stuff

I occassionally share music, recipes and other random tidbits from time to time.
